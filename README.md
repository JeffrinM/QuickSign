# Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Mediapipe and LSTM

This project enables real-time recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Built with Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and LSTM models, it aims to detect hand gestures through webcam video streams, providing a foundational tool for sign language communication.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Recognizes and displays ASL gestures with confidence scores.
- **Hand Landmark Detection**: Utilizes Mediapipe's hand detection to ensure accurate keypoint extraction.
- **Customizable Training**: Expandable for additional gestures and training on new actions.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and install necessary packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Run `data.py` to capture and save landmark data for training.
   - Customize the `actions` array in `function.py` to define gestures.

4. **Load the Pretrained Model**:
   Place your `model.json` and `model.h5` files in the main directory, or follow instructions to train your own model.

## Usage

To start real-time gesture detection:
```bash
python app.py
```
This script will:
   - Open a webcam feed
   - Detect hand gestures
   - Display recognized gestures and probabilities in real-time

Press `q` to exit the feed.

```

## How It Works

- **Data Collection**: `data.py` collects hand landmarks for each gesture and stores them for training.
- **Model**: The LSTM model processes sequences of hand landmarks, identifying patterns for each gesture.
- **Real-Time Inference**: `app.py` captures video, extracts keypoints, and feeds them into the model for prediction. 

## Future Improvements

- **Expand Gesture Vocabulary**: Include additional ASL gestures or customize for other sign languages.
- **Model Training**: Train the model with more sequences to improve accuracy and robustness.
